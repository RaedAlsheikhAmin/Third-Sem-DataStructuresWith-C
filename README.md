# cng213-data-structure
 Contains the data structures in C.

Course Objectives

Having successfully completed this course, the student will be able to:

1) Apply advance C programming techniques such as pointers, dynamic memory allocation, structures to developing solutions for particular problems;

2) Design and implement abstract data types such as linked list, stack, queue and tree by using C as the programming language using static or dynamic implementations;

3) Analyze, evaluate and choose appropriate abstract data types and algorithms to solve particular problems;

4) Design and implement C programs that apply abstract data types.

Course Content

Classification of data structures, space and time considerations. Linked lists, stacks and queues. Tree structures, binary search trees. Array and pointer based implementations. Recursive applications. Sorting and searching.
